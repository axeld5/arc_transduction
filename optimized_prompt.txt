You are given grid-based pattern-recognition tasks similar to ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus). Each problem provides:
- One or more Training Examples: each with an Input grid and its corresponding Output grid.
- A Test Case: with an Input grid and an empty Output section. Sometimes an "Output Placeholder" is shown; it is not the answer: correct it.

Your job is to infer the transformation rule from the training pair(s) and apply it to the Test Case Input to produce the correct Output grid.

Important domain details and conventions:
- Grids are rectangular matrices of digits 0–9, shown as space-separated numbers per row, with rows separated by newlines.
- Multiple colors (digits) can appear. The "background" color is typically the most prevalent color and often fills borders (commonly 0, 3, or 9), but must be inferred from the training examples—not assumed.
- Connectivity for shapes/components is 4-neighborhood (up, down, left, right).
- Output size may differ from input size; deduce this from the training outputs (e.g., cropping to a component’s bounding box).
- Common transformations include (but are not limited to):
  - Cropping to the bounding box of a selected component (e.g., largest connected component of a given color), preserving internal zeros for empty cells.
  - Translating components by a fixed offset, or "pushing" them toward an edge until blocked by the grid boundary or non-background cells (clipping if necessary).
  - Selecting the largest (by cell count) connected component; tie-break by the topmost, then leftmost component if needed.
  - Repositioning components (e.g., anchoring to a corner/edge), mirroring, rotation, outlining, filling holes, recoloring, or repeating patterns.
- When deducing translations:
  - Check if the training outputs reflect a constant offset. If offsets vary but consistently place the shape against a boundary, infer a "push-to-edge" rule in that direction (move until any further move would go out of bounds or collide with non-background cells).
- When deducing crops:
  - Verify if the output dimensions match the bounding box of a relevant component (often the largest non-background component). Map cells into the new grid by shifting the bounding box to the origin.
- Never invent new colors or dimensions unless implied by the examples. Preserve digits exactly as in the rule you infer.

Process to follow:
1) Parse all training input-output pairs. Identify background color(s), non-background components (4-connected), and any changes: size, position, color, or structure.
2) Hypothesize the simplest deterministic rule that explains all training pairs exactly (e.g., fixed translation, push-to-edge, crop to largest component, recolor, mirror, etc.).
3) Validate the hypothesis against all training pairs.
4) Apply the validated rule to the Test Case Input to produce the Output grid.

Formatting requirements:
- Output ONLY the final grid for the Test Case.
- Use the exact spacing: digits separated by a single space; each row on its own line.
- No extra text, no headings, no code fences, no reasoning, no trailing spaces, and no blank lines before or after.
- Correct the "Output Placeholder" shown; it is not the answer.

If multiple rules seem possible, choose the simplest rule that perfectly fits all training examples and apply it consistently. Do not state uncertainty; provide the single best output grid according to your inferred rule.
Output the grid and only the grid.
