# ARC Problem Filtering Summary

## Overview
The DSPy notebook (`dspy_prompt_opti.ipynb`) has been modified to filter problems based on their combined I/O score (0.25 × input + 0.75 × output character count).

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `init_arc_dataset()` Function
- Added optional `max_combined_score` parameter (default: 160)
- Loads statistics from `arc_statistics_detailed.json`
- Filters problems to only include those below the threshold
- Can be disabled by setting `max_combined_score=None`

### 2. Added `load_statistics()` Helper Function
- Reads the statistics JSON file
- Filters problems by combined score threshold
- Returns separate lists for training and evaluation problems

### 3. Updated Dataset Initialization
- Cell 3 now calls `init_arc_dataset(max_combined_score=160)`
- Added informative output showing filtering statistics

## Filtering Results

With threshold = 160:

| Dataset    | Filtered | Total | Percentage |
|------------|----------|-------|------------|
| Training   | 296      | 400   | 74.0%      |
| Evaluation | 215      | 400   | 53.8%      |
| **Total**  | **511**  | **800** | **63.9%**  |

### Dataset Split
After filtering and splitting:
- **Training set**: 148 problems (50% of filtered training data)
- **Validation set**: 148 problems (50% of filtered training data)
- **Test set**: 215 problems (all filtered evaluation data)

## Why Filter by Combined Score?

The combined score formula `0.25 × input + 0.75 × output` emphasizes the output size more heavily because:
1. **Generation complexity**: Larger outputs require more tokens to generate
2. **Cost efficiency**: Smaller problems are faster and cheaper to process
3. **Training speed**: Filtered dataset trains ~37% faster (511 vs 800 problems)
4. **Quality focus**: Start with simpler problems before tackling complex ones

## Verified Examples

Sample filtered problems (all scores < 160):
- `train_007bbfb7`: combined_score = 63.00
- `train_017c7c7b`: combined_score = 24.75
- `train_025d127b`: combined_score = 99.33
- `eval_00576224`: combined_score = 28.00
- `eval_03560426`: combined_score = 100.00

## Usage

To use different thresholds, modify cell 3 in the notebook:

```python
# Use threshold of 160 (default)
train_set, val_set, test_set = init_arc_dataset(max_combined_score=160)

# Use threshold of 200 for more problems
train_set, val_set, test_set = init_arc_dataset(max_combined_score=200)

# Disable filtering (use all problems)
train_set, val_set, test_set = init_arc_dataset(max_combined_score=None)
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster iteration**: ~37% reduction in dataset size
2. **Better convergence**: Simpler problems help model learn patterns faster
3. **Cost savings**: Fewer tokens per problem means lower API costs
4. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust threshold or disable filtering
5. **Quality control**: Focus on problems with reasonable complexity
