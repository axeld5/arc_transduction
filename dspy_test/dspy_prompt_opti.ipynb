      "2025/09/05 20:54:35 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for predict: You are given ARC-style grid puzzles. Each puzzle contains several training examples (input grid -> output grid) and one test case (input grid only). Your task is to infer the transformation rule from the training pairs and apply it to the test input. Then output ONLY the resulting grid for the test case in the exact required formatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domain facts and conventions:\n",
      "- Grids are 2D arrays of integers 0–9 separated by single spaces. Rows are separated by newlines.\n",
      "- 0 denotes background/empty. Non-zero digits denote colored cells; each digit is a separate color.\n",
      "- Connected components are defined with 4-neighborhood (up, down, left, right).\n",
      "- Bounding box of a component is the minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing all its cells.\n",
      "- Many tasks use one or more of these transformations:\n",
      "  - Cropping: output is a cropped rectangle (often a component’s bounding box) rather than the full input size.\n",
      "  - Selection by property: choose a specific component based on a distinctive property (e.g., symmetry, size, location, color).\n",
      "    • Example seen: Select the component whose bounding-box rows are palindromic; output is the bounding-box crop of that component.\n",
      "  - Overlay/painting: draw a new shape on top of the input, typically using a fixed color (often 4) at specified positions.\n",
      "    • Example seen: Find a full vertical line and a full horizontal line of non-zero cells; at their intersection, overwrite a 3×3 block of color 4 centered there, but preserve the center cell’s original value.\n",
      "  - Translation: move/copy a cluster so that a distinguished “anchor” cell aligns with a target anchor.\n",
      "    • This may use rare/unique markers (e.g., color 1) as anchors. If used, translate the entire cluster by the vector between anchors; clear the original location if that matches all training outputs.\n",
      "- Overlap/priority: When painting/overlaying, reproduce exactly what the training pairs show:\n",
      "  - If training shows that the center of a mask retains its original color, preserve it.\n",
      "  - If painting overwrites non-zero cells, do so only if training outputs confirm it.\n",
      "  - If some cells remain untouched (including zeros), keep them unchanged unless training indicates otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to solve:\n",
      "1) Parse all training examples. For each:\n",
      "   - Extract features: component list per color (with positions, sizes, bounding boxes), full-length lines (rows/cols entirely or conspicuously filled), symmetry (row/column palindromes), anchors (rare or unique colors like 1), and relative layouts.\n",
      "   - Compute differences between input and output: size changes (cropping vs same size), moved components (translation vectors), added shapes (constant-color masks), preserved/changed cells.\n",
      "2) Hypothesis formation:\n",
      "   - Propose the simplest rule that explains all training pairs exactly. Consider the common ARC motifs mentioned above (cropping by property, painting at intersections, translation to align anchors).\n",
      "   - Validate your rule by re-generating each training output from its input. If any mismatch occurs, revise the rule.\n",
      "   - If multiple rules fit, prefer the one that:\n",
      "     • Uses consistent, simple properties (symmetry, intersections, unique anchors).\n",
      "     • Uses a consistent paint color (often 4) if new pixels are drawn.\n",
      "     • Uses 4-neighborhood connectivity for components.\n",
      "3) Apply the validated rule to the test input to produce the test output.\n",
      "   - Respect output size: if the rule implies cropping, output only the cropped rectangle (no padding). Otherwise, keep the full original size.\n",
      "   - Respect overwrite/preserve behavior exactly as learned from training.\n",
      "4) Output formatting requirements:\n",
      "   - Provide two sections:\n",
      "     • reasoning: A brief, precise explanation of the inferred rule and how you applied it (one or a few short paragraphs).\n",
      "     • answer: The grid only, with each row on its own line and single spaces between numbers.\n",
      "   - Do not include any extra text, headers, or trailing spaces inside the answer grid.\n",
      "   - The answer grid must match the intended dimensions exactly (either cropped or full, as dictated by the rule).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips for robust inference:\n",
      "- Check for unique or rare colors (like a single ‘1’): they often serve as anchors or centers.\n",
      "- Detect straight lines (full-length or conspicuously long) and their intersections; intersection-centered masks appear frequently.\n",
      "- Examine symmetry (palindromic rows/columns) within component crops to select the correct component.\n",
      "- When translation is suspected, compute the offset vector from source anchor to target anchor and move the entire source cluster accordingly; confirm this reproduces the training outputs before applying to test.\n",
      "- Always verify your rule on every training example before applying it to the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your scoring depends entirely on the exactness of the output grid. Ensure the spacing, newlines, and dimensions match perfectly.\n",

      "- Directionality and selectivity must be inferred from training:\n",
      "  • Determine whether bridging is applied vertically, horizontally, or both by inspecting where 2s appear in the training Outputs.\n",
      "  • Nuance observed in prior tasks: some rows with exactly two isolated 1s were not bridged horizontally, while rows with multiple 1s/clusters were bridged. If the training Outputs show that horizontal bridging is omitted for certain row types (e.g., rows with precisely two 1s far apart), then do not apply horizontal bridging to those row types in the test.

Your job is to infer the transformation that maps each training input to its output, then apply the same rule to the Test Case Input and return the resulting grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these guidelines carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Input/output format\n",
      "- Each grid is a rectangle of space-separated integers, one row per line.\n",
      "- Training Examples are labeled “Input:” and “Output:” and define the rule.\n",
      "- The Test Case provides only “Input:”. You must produce the corresponding “Output:” grid.\n",
      "- Output must match the required dimensions implied by the rule (same size as input unless the examples show otherwise).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) General approach\n",
      "- Identify connected components (4-neighbor connectivity) of nonzero colors. For each component, compute:\n",
      "  - Its color.\n",
      "  - Its shape (the exact set of cells).\n",
      "  - Its bounding box (height, width, top-left position).\n",
      "- Hypothesize the rule by comparing each Input→Output pair. Validate your hypothesis against all training pairs. If any example contradicts your hypothesis, revise it.\n",
      "- Consider typical ARC operations:\n",
      "  - Geometric transforms: row/column reordering, reflection, rotation, translation.\n",
      "  - Copying/duplicating/concatenating rows/blocks (e.g., reverse+original, stack).\n",
      "  - Detecting and filling structures: frames/rectangles whose borders are one color and interiors are filled based on size/rank; filling between anchor markers in lines.\n",
      "  - Region/shape relocation while preserving a background or a frame (0 is often background; some colors, e.g., 4 or 5, can act as persistent frames/canvases).\n",
      "  - Overwrite behavior: non-background elements overwrite 0s; frames/protected colors are not overwritten unless examples show otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Domain-specific patterns seen in similar tasks\n",
      "Use these patterns as candidates when hypothesizing rules; confirm against the training pairs before applying.\n",
      "\n",
      "A) Shift-by-size\n",
      "- Each solid rectangular block (uniform-color component) is moved straight in one direction by a distance equal to a property of the block (commonly its own height). Columns remain unchanged if it’s a vertical shift.\n",
      "- Example behavior: every colored rectangle moves upward by the number of rows it occupies.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) Frame interior fill with rank-based colors\n",
      "- Detect rectangles whose border is a specific color (e.g., 4). Treat the interior (excluding the 1-cell border) as fillable.\n",
      "- If multiple such frames exist, interior colors may be assigned by size ranking (e.g., smaller interior gets color 1, larger interior gets color 2). Border cells remain unchanged.\n",
      "- Verify ranking rule across examples (by area or another clear measure) before applying.\n",
      "\n",
      "C) 3×3 supergrid of tiles from an adjacent equal-sized pair\n",
      "- Detect pairs of equal-sized “tiles” (components with identical bounding box size and uniform color) that are adjacent either horizontally (left tile A beside right tile B) or vertically (top tile A above bottom tile B). Adjacency means sharing an edge; diagonals do not count.\n",
      "- Rule: Form a 3×3 arrangement (supergrid) of these tiles, where each tile in the supergrid has the same size as the original tiles’ bounding box.\n",
      "  - The center tile of the supergrid is B (right/bottom tile’s color).\n",
      "  - The other eight tiles (all positions except the center) are filled with A (left/top tile’s color).\n",
      "- Placement: Center the 3×3 supergrid so that its center tile (B) sits exactly at B’s original location. Any parts extending beyond the grid are clipped (discarded).\n",
      "- Multiple pairs: Apply this construction for every qualifying pair detected.\n",
      "- Overlap/priority:\n",
      "  - Generated tiles overwrite background (0).\n",
      "  - The center B tiles should not be overwritten by the surrounding A tiles.\n",
      "  - When supergrids from different pairs overlap:\n",
      "    - B tiles from any pair take precedence over A tiles from any pair.\n",
      "    - If two B tiles overlap, resolve deterministically (e.g., process pairs in reading order by the B tile’s top-left: top-to-bottom, then left-to-right), with later B overwriting earlier, unless training examples imply a different priority.\n",
      "  - Do not overwrite frame/protected colors unless examples show it happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Applying the inferred rule to the Test Case\n",
      "- Use the single rule that explains all training pairs. Do not mix unrelated operations.\n",
      "- Handle collisions/overlaps exactly as the examples demonstrate. If a stable frame/canvas color is preserved in examples, preserve it in the test as well.\n",
      "- Clip any generated content to the grid bounds; discard out-of-bounds portions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Output formatting (strict)\n",
      "- Output only the resulting grid, nothing else (no headings, labels, or explanations).\n",
      "- Use exactly one space between numbers in a row.\n",
      "- No leading/trailing spaces on any line.\n",
      "- Use the exact number of rows and columns determined by the rule.\n",
      "- Preserve row order; each row ends with a newline.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Quality checks before submitting\n",
      "- The inferred rule must explain every training Input→Output pair precisely.\n",
      "- Re-check:\n",
      "  - Component detection (sizes, positions) is consistent.\n",
      "  - Direction and magnitude of movements/expansions match examples.\n",
      "  - For frame fills, borders are unchanged and interiors use correct colors by the established size/rank rule.\n",
      "  - For supergrids, tile size equals the original tiles’ bounding box; the center is B; surrounding tiles are A; clipping and overlay priority are handled as above.\n",
      "- Ensure your final grid conforms to the strict output formatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes\n",
      "- 0 is typically the background; nonzero colors denote objects/shapes.\n",
      "- Some colors may act as structural frames/canvases and tend to persist; infer such protection from the examples.\n",
      "- When in doubt between multiple plausible rules, prefer the simplest one that fits all training pairs without exception.\n",

Your job is to infer the transformation that maps each training input to its output, then apply the same rule to the Test Case Input and return the resulting grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core approach\n",
      "- Parse the format:\n",
      "  - Each grid is a rectangle of space-separated integers, one row per line.\n",
      "  - Training Examples are labeled “Input:” and “Output:”.\n",
      "  - The Test Case provides only “Input:”. You must produce the corresponding “Output:” grid.\n",

      "- Validate your hypothesis against every training example; if any mismatch appears, revise the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to look for (common ARC patterns observed in prior tasks)\n",
      "- Background vs. structure:\n",
      "  - 0 is often background. Non-zero colors are often structural or movable.\n",
      "  - Certain colors may serve as anchors, frames, or separators. For example, a solid row/column of 4s can be a divider between two halves to compare.\n",
      "- Mirrors/rotations/translations:\n",
      "  - Shapes or blocks may be reflected, rotated, or shifted and re-colored (e.g., copying a 1-shape elsewhere as 2s).\n",
      "  - If you hypothesize sub-block extraction/rotation, determine exact bounding boxes from the data; avoid assuming fixed coordinates across puzzles.\n",
      "- Fill/overwrite behavior:\n",
      "  - Added elements typically write into zeros only, leaving existing non-zero colors intact, unless examples show overwriting.\n",
      "  - When two writes collide, deduce overwrite priority from training pairs (do not assume a fixed priority).\n",
      "- Split-and-compare constructions:\n",
      "  - If a solid separator row/column (often all 4s) splits the grid, the output may be a per-cell comparison between the two halves (e.g., top vs. bottom).\n",
      "  - A frequent pattern: output uses a specific color (often 3) to mark per-cell differences between the halves (e.g., 3 if top≠bottom, 0 if equal), possibly focusing on specific colors (like comparing 0 vs 2).\n",
      "- Quadrant aggregation:\n",
      "  - Large grids (e.g., 8×8) may be four 4×4 quadrants dominated by distinct colors (e.g., 4,5,6,9). Outputs are often 4×4 built cellwise from the corresponding cells across quadrants.\n",
      "  - The selection rule must be inferred from the training pairs:\n",
      "    - It could be “first non-zero in a specific scan order”, “last non-zero”, “majority/non-zero-most-frequent”, or a learned priority among colors/quadrants.\n",
      "    - Do not assume a global color priority; derive it from contradictions/resolutions across all training examples.\n",
      "- Edge/offset shadows:\n",
      "  - Sometimes you must place a “shadow” or outline (e.g., color 2 or 3) adjacent to or to the left/right of an existing shape (like the left-of-first-1 per row), but only where supported by all training pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Process to build and verify the rule\n",
      "1) Carefully record what changes from each training Input to Output:\n",
      "   - Which cells change? Which colors? Where (rows/cols, relative to shapes/edges)?\n",
      "   - Are sizes the same or reduced/combined (e.g., forming a 4×4 from quadrants)?\n",
      "2) Propose a minimal, general rule and test it on every training example.\n",
      "3) Resolve conflicts by refining:\n",
      "   - If multiple sources can write to a cell, infer overwrite/selection precedence from the examples (e.g., scan order among quadrants or explicit color priority learned from the data).\n",
      "   - If a separator (like a row of 4s) is present, consider per-cell comparisons of the corresponding halves.\n",
      "   - If a new color appears systematically (e.g., 3 marking differences), confirm that behavior across all training pairs.\n",
      "4) Only when the rule reproduces all training outputs exactly should you apply it to the Test Case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Output formatting requirements (strict)\n",
      "- Output only the resulting grid, nothing else (no explanations, labels, or code fences).\n",
      "- Use exactly one space between numbers in a row.\n",
      "- Do not add leading/trailing spaces on any line.\n",
      "- Use the exact number of rows and columns required by the rule.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quality checks before submitting\n",
      "- Your rule must explain every training Input→Output pair exactly.\n",
      "- Confirm overwrite/collision priority and any color-mapping are consistent with all examples.\n",
      "- Double-check dimensions, block coordinates, rotations/reflections, and that you write only where allowed by the learned rule (usually into zeros unless shown otherwise).\n",
      "- Ensure the final printed grid adheres to the strict spacing and newline requirements above.\n",

      "Goal:\n",
      "- Infer the transformation rule from the given training example(s) (each with an Input grid and its Output grid).\n",
      "- Apply that same rule to the Test Case Input to produce the Test Case Output.\n",
      "- Return the final grid in the exact required format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input format:\n",
      "- Grids are rectangular arrays of integers. Each row is on its own line; numbers in a row are separated by single spaces.\n",
      "- 0 denotes background; nonzero integers denote colors.\n",
      "- Training data contains one or more pairs: “Input:” grid -> “Output:” grid.\n",
      "- The Test Case contains only “Input:”; you must produce its “Output:”.\n",
      "- Output grids may be the same size as their inputs or a different size, depending on the inferred rule.\n",

      "- Derive a single rule that explains all training pairs. Validate the rule by checking that applying it to each training Input reproduces its Output exactly (shape, colors, positions).\n",
      "- Then apply that rule to the Test Case Input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core concepts and tools:\n",
      "- Treat distinct numbers as distinct colors.\n",
      "- Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) to define connected components unless a task explicitly indicates diagonal logic.\n",
      "- Common operations to consider (use only those supported by the training evidence):\n",
      "  - Component-level transforms: translate components (vertical/horizontal shifts), align to a reference component’s top row/bottom row/center, keep shape and orientation unless training shows rotation/reflection.\n",
      "  - Region-based transforms: detect frames, separators, or partitions (e.g., rows/columns of 1s forming borders). Often:\n",
      "    - Horizontal and vertical lines of 1s can define an interior sub-grid to operate on.\n",
      "    - Corner cells may contain labels; interior markers (e.g., 8) may be reassigned based on proximity (often Manhattan distance) to these corner labels.\n",
      "    - Output may be the interior sub-grid only (dimensions shrink by removing the border/separators).\n",
      "  - Pattern detection and morphological logic:\n",
      "    - Recognize simple shapes (rings, plus signs, rectangles, lines).\n",
      "    - Example: a 3x3 ring of 1s (center 0, perimeter 1s) might be transformed into a plus of another color (center and orthogonal neighbors set) while clearing diagonals—apply exactly as training shows.\n",
      "  - Color remapping: map one color to another based on position, distance, or pattern role.\n",
      "  - Distance metrics: unless training indicates otherwise, use Manhattan distance for “nearest” decisions.\n",
      "- Preserve properties demonstrated in training:\n",
      "  - Maintain components’ shapes and relative order unless training shows merging/splitting.\n",
      "  - Preserve rows or columns during shifts if training shows pure vertical or horizontal movement.\n",
      "  - When aligning to a reference (e.g., align all components’ top rows to the top row of the 1-colored component), identify the reference precisely from training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Process:\n",
      "1) Parse all training pairs.\n",
      "2) Identify invariant structures and changes:\n",
      "   - Borders/separators\n",
      "   - Interior regions\n",
      "   - Which colors move or change and how\n",
      "   - Whether the output size matches a sub-region or the whole grid\n",
      "3) Formulate a concise, general rule that fits every training pair.\n",
      "4) Re-apply it to each training Input to verify exact reproduction of the training Outputs. If any mismatch, refine the rule.\n",
      "5) Apply the validated rule to the Test Case Input to produce the Output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Output formatting requirements:\n",
      "- Return only the final grid for the Test Case Output.\n",
      "- Each row on its own line.\n",
      "- Single spaces between numbers.\n",
      "- No extra spaces at ends of lines.\n",
      "- No extra text, labels, or explanations in the final answer block.\n",
      "- If you provide reasoning, put it before the final grid and clearly separate it. Ensure the final block is just the grid so it can be parsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality checks before submitting:\n",
      "- Dimensions: Ensure the output grid matches the rule (may be smaller/larger than input if the rule trims to an interior or composes a new canvas).\n",
      "- Exactness: Values and positions must match what the rule dictates; do not approximate.\n",
      "- Consistency: The same rule must explain all training examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "When in doubt:\n",
      "- Prefer the simplest rule that exactly fits all training examples.\n",
      "- Avoid overfitting to a single training pair; ensure generalization across all provided pairs.\n",

Your job is to infer the transformation that maps each training input to its output, then apply the same rule to the Test Case and print the resulting grid.\n",

      "- The Test Case provides only “Input:”. You must produce the corresponding “Output:” grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "General principles\n",
      "- Infer a single deterministic rule that explains every training pair exactly; then apply it to the Test Case.\n",
      "- 0 is often background. Non-zero colors are often structural or movable. Added elements usually write into zeros only, unless examples show overwriting.\n",

      "1) Parse and measure:\n",
      "   - Confirm each grid’s dimensions; note whether output size equals input size or changes.\n",

      "\n",
      "3) Hypothesis candidates (common ARC patterns):\n",
      "   - Counting to canonical layout:\n",
      "     - The count of a particular color in the input determines how many markers (often a fixed color) are placed into a designated strip (commonly the top row), left-to-right, with defined overflow behavior (e.g., next row center). Verify placement order and overflow positions from training.\n",
      "   - Diagonal or directional propagation from blocks:\n",
      "     - 2×2 seeds often “emit” a line/diagonal from a specific corner in a specific direction, per color. Determine:\n",
      "       - Which corner of the 2×2 is the anchor (e.g., top-left for up-left diagonal, bottom-right for down-right).\n",
      "       - The exact step direction (e.g., up-left, down-right), how far it extends (typically until the grid edge), and whether original blocks are preserved (usually yes).\n",
      "       - That directions can differ by color (learn them from training).\n",
      "   - Mirrors/rotations/translations:\n",
      "     - Shapes may be reflected/rotated/copied and possibly recolored. If so, derive bounding boxes programmatically, determine the exact transform, and confirm it on all examples.\n",
      "   - Split-and-compare via separators:\n",
      "     - A solid row/column of a single color can split the grid. Outputs may be built by comparing corresponding cells between regions (equality/inequality markers, color-focused comparisons).\n",
      "   - Quadrant aggregation:\n",
      "     - Large grids that look like four quadrants can reduce to a smaller grid where each output cell is selected from the corresponding cells of the quadrants (first/last non-zero, majority, learned priority).\n",
      "   - Motif copying anchored by a color:\n",
      "     - Only adopt this if training shows a clearly repeated local pattern (motif) and a consistent anchor cell/color.\n",
      "     - Verify: the motif appears verbatim (including orientation/rotations if present) wherever the anchor appears in training; define collision/overwrite policy from examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Overwrite/collision policy:\n",
      "   - Default: write into zeros only; do not overwrite non-zero cells unless training outputs show overwriting.\n",
      "   - If multiple writes collide, derive the precedence from the training outputs (e.g., per-color priority or last-writer wins). Do not assume a fixed global priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Rigorously validate:\n",
      "   - Reproduce every training Output exactly (cell-by-cell) from your rule. Check:\n",

      "6) Apply to the Test Case:\n",
      "   - Apply the validated rule consistently to all relevant structures/colors in the Test Input.\n",

      "Quality and formatting requirements (strict)\n",
      "- Output only the resulting grid, nothing else (no explanations, labels, or code fences).\n",
      "- Use exactly one space between numbers in a row; no leading/trailing spaces on any line.\n",
      "- Each row ends with a newline; print the exact number of rows/columns dictated by the rule.\n",
      "- Double-check dimensions, coordinates, and that you write only where the rule allows (usually into zeros unless shown otherwise).\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips distilled from prior tasks\n",
      "- Count-to-layout patterns: sometimes the output places a number of markers equal to the count of a specific input color into a canonical region (e.g., fill the top row left-to-right; overflow to defined cells). Deduce the exact placement order from training.\n",
      "- Diagonal propagation from 2×2 seeds: color-specific directionality is common (e.g., color 1 may propagate up-left from the block’s top-left; color 2 may propagate down-right from the block’s bottom-right). Keep original blocks intact; extend until the grid boundary.\n",
      "- Per-color independence: when multiple colors have similar seeds, infer and apply direction/behavior per color rather than assuming a single shared rule.\n",
      "- Avoid overfitting to an imagined motif: only copy/rotate motifs if the training pairs demonstrate that behavior unequivocally (same motif repeated at all anchor occurrences). Otherwise, prefer simpler local propagation or comparison rules.\n",

      "General reasoning process:\n",
      "1) Parse and inspect structure:\n",
      "   - Note grid dimensions.\n",
      "   - Detect full-color rows/columns that act as frames or separators (e.g., an entire row/column of a single color). These often remain unchanged across transformations and define panels or borders.\n",
      "   - Check if the grid is partitioned by separator lines into sub-panels (e.g., 17×17 split by single-color lines into a 3×3 array of 5×5 panels).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Identify which colors are structural and which are movable/fillers:\n",
      "   - Structural colors often include:\n",
      "     - Frame/border colors (e.g., a full top/bottom/left/right border).\n",
      "     - Separator lines inside the grid (e.g., color 9 or 8 forming full rows/columns at regular intervals).\n",
      "   - Movable/filler/marker colors are those that change or trigger painting (e.g., 3 as a seed/filler; shape colors like 1,2,4 that define patterns).\n",
      "   - Overwrite rule unless contradicted by training: do not overwrite non-zero cells; paint only into zeros. Frame/separator colors generally remain unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Hypothesis formation and verification:\n",
      "   - Infer a transformation hypothesis and test it against every training pair. If any mismatch occurs, refine the hypothesis.\n",
      "   - Ensure your hypothesis explains all training pairs exactly before applying it to the Test Case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common ARC patterns to consider (use only if consistent with all training pairs):\n",
      "- Panelization by separators (e.g., 17×17 with 3×3 panels of 5×5 separated by 1-pixel lines):\n",
      "  - Identify the separator color (e.g., 9).\n",
      "  - Treat the grid as a tiled array of panels bounded by those separator lines.\n",
      "  - Typical rule seen: compute unions of shape positions across panel-rows and/or panel-columns (ignoring the separator lines themselves), and fill corresponding positions in all panels with the separator color, but only into zeros.\n",
      "  - Do not overwrite existing non-zero shape cells or the separator lines.\n",
      "  - Apply uniformly to all panels: if a union indicates a cell position should be filled, fill that position in every panel in the affected row/column where the cell is zero. Be careful to fill all indicated positions; do not leave gaps that contradict the training outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Flood-fill from seed color into zeros:\n",
      "  - Seeds (often color 3) expand to fill 4-neighbor-connected zero regions.\n",
      "  - Obstacles: any non-zero color (e.g., 8, 2, etc.) blocks expansion unless a training pair shows otherwise.\n",
      "  - Only zeros reachable from seed cells via 4-neighbor moves are recolored to the seed color; do not overwrite non-zeros or cross separators unless explicitly shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Recoloring markers by nearest border (two opposite full-color borders):\n",
      "  - When the grid has solid opposite borders (e.g., left column all 5 and right column all 4), and markers (often 3) appear inside:\n",
      "    - Replace each marker with the color of the nearer border measured along the perpendicular axis (left-right borders → compare horizontal distances; top-bottom borders → compare vertical distances).\n",
      "    - Ties break toward the top or left (as demonstrated in training).\n",
      "    - Only the markers change; other cells remain as-is.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Line-of-sight/interval filling:\n",
      "  - Some tasks fill contiguous runs between anchors along rows/columns, stopping at obstacles as implied by training.\n",
      "  - Always confirm exact stop/through behavior (what blocks? do separators block? which colors act as anchors?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Collision/priority and overwrite behavior:\n",
      "- Default: write only into zeros; do not overwrite non-zero cells (shape, marker, frame, or separator) unless a training example demonstrates overwriting.\n",
      "- Frames/separators remain unchanged unless training shows they are modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality checks before submitting:\n",
      "- Verify the rule reproduces every single training Output exactly from its Input (cell-by-cell).\n",
      "- Confirm dimensions of the Test Case Output match the rule’s requirement (same size as input unless stacking/concatenation is clearly indicated by training).\n",
      "- Ensure spacing/newlines are exact; output only the grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Execution checklist:\n",
      "- Detect frames/separators and panels if present.\n",
      "- Determine which colors are acting as seeds, shapes, frames, or separators.\n",
      "- Choose the simplest hypothesis consistent with all training pairs.\n",
      "- Validate hypothesis by mentally re-applying it to each training Input and confirming the Output matches exactly.\n",
      "- Apply the verified rule to the Test Case Input.\n",
      "- Output the resulting grid only, formatted exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember:\n",
      "- Use all training pairs to constrain the rule; avoid assumptions not supported by all training examples.\n",
      "- Be meticulous about not missing fills dictated by unions or connectivity.\n",
      "- Do not include any reasoning or extra text in the final output; print only the grid.\n",

      "\n",
      "Your task is to infer a single deterministic rule from the Training Examples and apply it to the Test Case input to produce the correct Output grid.\n",

      "- Grids are rectangular, represented as rows of space-separated integers (typically 0–9).\n",
      "- Rows are separated by newlines. Keep grid dimensions unchanged.\n",
      "- Your final reply must contain only the transformed grid for the Test Case, formatted exactly like the examples: single spaces between numbers, one row per line, no extra text, no prefixes, no blank lines.\n",

      "- Frame/wall: a structure (often of a single color, e.g., 5) that can bound or enclose regions.\n",
      "- Enclosed region (hole): a set of cells (often zeros) that cannot reach the grid boundary via any 4-neighbor path that does not pass through wall cells. To detect holes reliably, flood-fill the outside: treat the wall color as blocking; any zero not reached from the outside is enclosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to solve:\n",
      "1) Parse all Training Examples. For each pair (Input → Output), compute the exact differences:\n",
      "   - Which cells changed color? From what to what?\n",
      "   - Which colors/components remained unchanged?\n",
      "   - Are changes driven by local adjacency (e.g., multi-cell vs isolated), enclosure by a frame, or by position relative to a prominent structure (e.g., to the right of a vertical bar of 5s)?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Generate candidate rules that could explain all observed changes. Common, reusable patterns include:\n",
      "   - Adjacency-based recoloring: e.g., recolor cells of a given color only if they belong to a multi-cell connected component (have at least one 4-neighbor of the same color); leave isolated instances unchanged.\n",
      "   - Enclosure fill: treat a specific color (often 5) as walls; fill only the cells truly enclosed by those walls (e.g., zeros inside a 5-frame) with a target color (often 2). Do not fill bays or areas that are open to the grid edge via any 4-neighbor path.\n",
      "   - Anchored/relative recoloring: identify a salient reference structure (often a line/rectangle of 5s). Recolor exactly one specific connected component in a defined positional relationship to that structure (e.g., the component immediately to the right of the central 5-column) to match the examples. Only recolor the intended component; leave others unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Rigorously validate each candidate rule against all Training Examples:\n",
      "   - It must reproduce every Training Output exactly (same changed cells, same target colors).\n",
      "   - Prefer the simplest rule consistent with all examples (fewest arbitrary conditions; minimal necessary changes).\n",
      "   - If multiple nearby components could be candidates (e.g., several to the right of a 5-column), select the one that makes all Training Outputs match exactly. Do not assume; verify against all examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Apply the validated rule to the Test Case Input:\n",
      "   - Use 4-neighbor connectivity for all component and enclosure reasoning.\n",
      "   - When filling enclosed regions: perform an outside flood-fill (treat wall color as blocking) to distinguish open vs enclosed areas. Only fill truly enclosed cells.\n",
      "   - When recoloring components: recolor every cell in the chosen connected component, and only that component.\n",
      "   - Preserve all other cells and colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality and formatting checks before you answer:\n",
      "- Grid size unchanged; only intended cells changed.\n",
      "- No unintended recoloring (e.g., don’t recolor multiple components when only one is indicated by training).\n",
      "- For enclosure tasks, only fill cells that are not reachable from the grid boundary without crossing walls.\n",
      "- Output exactly the grid, with single spaces between numbers and correct newlines. Do not include any explanation or extra lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pitfalls to avoid (observed in prior attempts):\n",

      "- Filling regions that are not fully enclosed (use the outside flood-fill to confirm enclosure).\n",

Your job is to infer the transformation rule from the training examples and apply it to the Test Case input to produce its Output grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these instructions carefully:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Understand the data format\n",
      "- Grids are rectangular arrays of small nonnegative integers (0–9). Interpret each distinct nonzero integer as a color; 0 is background.\n",
      "- Training data consists of one or more pairs: Input grid → Output grid. The Test Case section includes only an Input grid; you must produce its Output.\n",
      "- Output dimensions may be the same as the input or may change, depending on the pattern. Infer the correct output size from the training pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Derive the rule from the training examples\n",
      "- Parse each training Input/Output pair into matrices.\n",
      "- Identify all relevant properties:\n",
      "  - Colors present; which colors persist, are removed, or are recolored.\n",
      "  - Connected components (use 4-neighborhood connectivity: up, down, left, right).\n",
      "  - Component attributes: size, bounding box, thickness, border vs interior pixels, endpoints, corners, symmetry.\n",
      "  - Global structures: full rows/columns of a single color, central crosses, quadrants, bands, or tiling/replication.\n",
      "  - Spatial transforms: horizontal/vertical reflection, rotation, translation, cropping to a bounding box, removing a central cross, or assembling quadrants.\n",
      "  - Morphological operations: outline extraction (border), erosion (interior only), dilation/fill, skeletonization, thinning, thickening.\n",
      "  - Recoloring rules: mapping input color(s) to output color(s), possibly introducing colors that were not in the input (e.g., recoloring all “5”s into “8” and “2” according to a structural role). Keep 0 as background unless training shows otherwise.\n",
      "- Form one or more candidate rules that explain every training pair exactly. Validate a candidate by re-applying it (mentally) to each training Input and checking it reproduces the given Output precisely (including sizes and colors). Prefer the simplest rule that matches all training examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Special patterns frequently seen in this task\n",
      "- Cross/quadrant puzzles: If you see a complete central row and column of a single color V (forming a “plus” across the entire grid), the solution often removes that cross and composes the four quadrants into a new 2n×2n grid (for odd (2n+1)×(2n+1) inputs), possibly mirroring or copying a single quadrant pattern into all four, and possibly recoloring the quadrant pattern to V.\n",
      "- Two-color interactions: With exactly two nonzero colors, outputs may:\n",
      "  - Keep only one color (remove the other) based on a consistent criterion (e.g., majority/minority, inside vs outside, structural role), possibly simplifying or symmetrizing the retained shapes.\n",
      "  - Transform one color based on the geometry of the other (masking, mirroring within the other’s bounding box).\n",
      "- Recoloring a single input color into two output colors: Often partitions a shape into “border vs interior,” “spine vs bulk,” “corners/endpoints vs body,” or by run/segment structure, using two new colors consistently across all examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Apply the rule to the Test Case\n",
      "- Once a rule is validated on all training pairs, apply it to the Test Input to construct the Output grid.\n",
      "- Ensure color mapping is consistent with the training-derived rule.\n",
      "- Ensure the output size matches the pattern implied by the rule (not necessarily the input size).\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Output format requirements (strict)\n",
      "- Output ONLY the final grid for the Test Case, with:\n",
      "  - Rows separated by a single newline.\n",
      "  - Values in a row separated by single spaces.\n",
      "  - All rows having the same number of columns.\n",
      "  - No extra characters: no labels, no “reasoning,” no headers, no code fences, no trailing spaces, and no blank lines before or after.\n",
      "- The output must match the expected formatting exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Quality and consistency checks\n",
      "- Before finalizing, mentally re-verify that your inferred rule reproduces every training Output exactly from its Input.\n",
      "- Sanity-check symmetry, counts, and colors on the Test Output.\n",
      "- If multiple rules seem plausible, choose the one that fits all training pairs exactly and yields a coherent Test Output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your goal is not to explain, but to deliver the correct Test Output grid in exact formatting after inferring the rule from the training examples.\n",

Your job is to infer the transformation from the training pairs and apply it to the Test Case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow this process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Understand the format\n",
      "- Each grid is a rectangle of space-separated integers, one row per line.\n",
      "- Training Examples are labeled “Input:” and “Output:”. The Test Case provides only “Input:”.\n",
      "- The output grid’s size may match the input or differ if the rule implies resizing or stacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Build a hypothesis that explains ALL training pairs\n",
      "- Propose a concrete rule, then verify it against every training pair. If any example contradicts your hypothesis, revise it.\n",
      "- Use the full set of training pairs to constrain orientation, alignment, and collision/overwrite rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Recognize common ARC motifs and how to apply them\n",
      "- Background and frames:\n",
      "  - 0 is often background; large uniform regions or stable frames/bands (e.g., color 5) typically remain unchanged while other colors move or get redrawn.\n",
      "  - When a color forms a full band (all cells in one or more rows/columns), treat it as a fixed “canvas” or wall that other elements compress toward or align with.\n",
      "- Anchor-based stamping (especially with color 4):\n",
      "  - A cluster (template) may contain “anchors” (often 4s) and “fill” (other colors like 1). Learn the template as the relative offsets of fill cells to anchors.\n",
      "  - Then find occurrences elsewhere of anchors in the same relative arrangement (allowing rotation/reflection only if supported by training) and “stamp” the fill cells at the corresponding offsets. Preserve anchors; fill typically overwrites 0s but not protected frame colors unless training shows otherwise.\n",
      "  - Do not require an exact window match unless training supports that; templates often generalize across the whole grid and may reappear around scattered anchors.\n",
      "- Compression toward a band (often color 5):\n",
      "  - If there is a horizontal band (full rows of 5), count per column how many non-5 elements appear above and below the band. Place that many 5s adjacent to the band on each side (above/below), stacking outward away from the band. Remove the original non-5 dots (replace with 0).\n",
      "  - If there is a vertical band (full columns of 5), perform the analogous operation per row (compress left/right into cells adjacent to the band), remove originals, keep the band.\n",
      "  - Newly placed 5s are contiguous runs adjacent to the band whose length equals the count of non-5s on that side in that line (row/column).\n",
      "- Alternating stripe fill anchored by a single nonzero:\n",
      "  - If there is a single nonzero pixel (e.g., 2/3/6/9) and an otherwise empty grid, fill all rows from the top down through that pixel’s original row (inclusive) with vertical alternating stripes of 4 and 0.\n",
      "  - Choose the phase so that the pixel’s column sits on a 4 in those stripes. Concretely, if the pixel’s column is even (0-based) then “4 0 4 0 …” with 4 at col0; if odd, “0 4 0 4 …” with 4 at col1; more generally: place 4s exactly in columns with the same parity as the pixel’s column.\n",
      "  - Then move the original nonzero one row down (same column). Do not overwrite it; the pattern occupies only the rows above/original row while the moved pixel occupies the row below.\n",
      "- Collisions/priority:\n",
      "  - Unless training shows otherwise, moving/adding elements overwrite 0s only, leaving stable frames (e.g., 5) and anchors intact.\n",
      "  - If templates or fills overlap, follow the precedence implied by training (e.g., anchors persist; fills do not overwrite anchors/frames).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Apply the rule to the Test Case precisely\n",
      "- Use the exact same operations, orientations, parities, counts, and overwrite behavior established by training.\n",
      "- For parity-sensitive patterns (like alternating stripes), align the phase (which columns are 4 vs 0) according to the anchoring column demonstrated in training (e.g., align 4s with the special pixel’s column).\n",
      "- For compression tasks, count per row/column, place contiguous runs adjacent to the band, and remove the original scattered dots.\n",
      "- For anchor-based stamping, detect all occurrences of the anchor configuration (including allowed rotations/reflections if demonstrated) and stamp the fill relative to anchors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Output formatting (strict)\n",
      "- Output only the resulting grid, nothing else.\n",
      "- One space between numbers, no leading/trailing spaces on any line.\n",
      "- Use the exact number of rows and columns determined by the rule.\n",
      "- Preserve row order; each row ends with a newline.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Quality checks before submitting\n",
      "- Your rule must explain every training Input→Output pair exactly.\n",
      "- Reproduce fine details: band orientation (horizontal vs vertical), compression counts and adjacency, stripe parity aligned to the anchor’s column, anchoring/stamping geometry, overwrite/priority behavior.\n",
      "- If your first hypothesis yields the Test Case == Input, double-check training; many tasks require nontrivial replication, compression, or parity alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "General tips\n",
      "- Compute bounding boxes of colored regions; inspect relative offsets between special colors (e.g., 4 anchors vs 1 fills).\n",
      "- Check for symmetry, reflections, and rotations only if explicitly supported by training pairs.\n",
      "- When multiple interpretations are possible, prefer the one that is consistent across all training examples and captures exact placements (parity, counts, adjacency).\n",

      "\n",
      "Input/Output format and constraints:\n",
      "- Grids are rectangular, rows of space-separated integers (0–9), one row per line.\n",
      "- The Output grid may be the same size as the Input or a different size (cropping/extraction tasks occur). Do not assume dimensions are preserved.\n",
      "- Your final reply must contain only the Output grid, formatted exactly with single spaces between numbers, one row per line, no extra text or blank lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core concepts:\n",
      "- Colors are integers 0–9; 0 commonly denotes background/unknown and may need filling, but treat 0 as a real color unless the learned rule dictates otherwise.\n",
      "- Connected component: cells of the same color connected via 4-neighborhood (up/down/left/right) only. Diagonals do not connect.\n",
      "- Frames/walls: structures (often a single color like 5) that can enclose regions.\n",
      "- Enclosed region (hole): a set of cells inaccessible from the outside boundary without crossing walls of the blocking color. Use outside flood-fill to disambiguate open vs enclosed areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "General approach:\n",
      "1) Parse all Training Examples and compute exact differences:\n",
      "   - Which cells/colors changed? From what to what?\n",
      "   - Which structures (components, lines, frames) remained?\n",
      "   - Did the output crop or resize relative to the input? If so, measure offset and size.\n",
      "   - Are changes driven by adjacency/connectivity, enclosure, periodic repetition, diagonal arithmetic patterns, or anchored relative positions?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Generate candidate rules that explain every Training pair exactly. Common reusable patterns include:\n",
      "   - Periodic tiling completion (2D periodicity):\n",
      "     • Many grids consist of a small fundamental tile that repeats across rows/columns. Zeros often indicate missing parts of this tile.\n",
      "     • Infer the smallest horizontal period (P) and vertical period (Q) consistent with all non-zero observations: positions that are congruent mod P (columns) and mod Q (rows) must agree in color whenever both are non-zero. Choose the minimal P, Q that satisfy the non-zero constraints.\n",
      "     • Reconstruct the fundamental tile: for each offset (r mod Q, c mod P), assign the color that is consistently observed among all occurrences with non-zero hints. Validate against all training outputs.\n",
      "     • Fill every zero by periodic extension of the inferred tile; never alter given non-zero cells unless required by the learned rule and consistent with all trainings.\n",
      "     • Avoid “donor row/column” cherry-picking: the fill must be globally consistent with the single inferred tile across both axes.\n",
      "   - Diagonal arithmetic stripes (modulo patterns):\n",
      "     • Colors repeat along diagonals; a common model is color determined by (row + col) mod k for some k.\n",
      "     • Determine k (the cycle length) and map each residue class to a color using the non-zero clues. Validate that this reproduces all outputs.\n",
      "   - Anchored/relative extraction or recoloring:\n",
      "     • Identify a unique salient anchor (often a distinct color like 5 occurring once).\n",
      "     • Derive a fixed offset (Δrow, Δcol) and size (H × W) of a subgrid relative to that anchor that matches all outputs (e.g., output = crop with top-left at (anchor_row + Δrow, anchor_col + Δcol), size H × W).\n",
      "     • Apply the same offset and size to the Test Input.\n",
      "   - Enclosure-based fill:\n",
      "     • Treat a specific color as a wall and perform outside flood-fill to identify holes. Fill only truly enclosed regions with the target color.\n",
      "   - Component-based operations:\n",
      "     • Recolor or select components meeting specific criteria (size, shape, adjacency to anchors/frames, or positional relation).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Rigorously validate the rule:\n",
      "   - It must recreate every Training Output exactly (including size if cropped).\n",
      "   - Prefer the simplest rule consistent with all examples (minimal arbitrary conditions).\n",
      "   - If multiple anchors/components fit, select the one that makes all outputs match.\n",
      "   - For periodic/tiling tasks, ensure one globally consistent tile; do not mix inconsistent donors.\n",
      "   - For modulo patterns, use the smallest k and a residue→color mapping consistent with all given non-zero cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Apply the validated rule to the Test Input:\n",
      "   - Use 4-neighborhood for connectivity/enclosure.\n",
      "   - For fills, change only the intended cells. Do not alter other colors unless the rule requires it.\n",
      "   - Preserve or change grid dimensions exactly as dictated by the learned rule (e.g., crop/extract vs in-place transform).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality and formatting checks before answering:\n",
      "- If the rule implies cropping/extraction, output the correctly sized subgrid.\n",
      "- If the rule implies periodic completion, confirm all zeros are filled consistently with the inferred tile and no non-zero hints are overwritten incorrectly.\n",
      "- For modulo/diagonal patterns, verify every cell follows the residue mapping.\n",
      "- No unintended recolorings or extra filled regions (especially avoid filling bays open to the boundary when the rule targets enclosed holes).\n",
      "- Output only the grid, with exact spaces and newlines, no explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pitfalls to avoid (observed previously):\n",
      "- Misidentifying donor rows/columns: do not fill zeros by local similarity if it breaks global periodicity; infer the smallest consistent 2D tile and use it everywhere.\n",
      "- Assuming dimensions are preserved: some tasks require cropping relative to an anchor; learn and apply the same offset/size across examples.\n",
      "- Using diagonal connectivity for components/enclosures (not allowed).\n",
      "- Filling regions that are not fully enclosed (use outside flood-fill to confirm).\n",
      "- Adding any extra text beyond the grid.\n",

      "     • Detect full rows/columns of a single color (e.g., lines of 8’s) that act as separators.\n",
      "     • Partition the grid into smaller tiles (subgrids) between these separators.\n",
      "     • Aggregate per-tile statistics (e.g., count of a particular color such as 6).\n",

      "   - Geometric transforms and structure assembly:\n",
      "     • Check for rotations, reflections, translations, scaling, or replication of shapes.\n",
      "     • Check for expansion/dilation of a specific color around anchors, or filling 3x3/line bands with a certain color around marked positions.\n",
      "     • Identify if certain colors act as “background,” “separator,” or “accent” to be propagated or rearranged.\n",

Your job is to infer the transformation that maps each training input to its output, then apply the same rule to the Test Case and return the resulting grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input format\n",
      "- Each grid is a rectangle of space-separated integers, one row per line.\n",
      "- Training examples are labeled “Input:” and “Output:”.\n",
      "- The Test Case provides only “Input:”. You must produce the corresponding “Output:” grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core method\n",
      "1) Carefully compare each training Input→Output pair.\n",
      "   - What changes? Which cells, colors, locations? Are dimensions preserved or reduced?\n",
      "   - Do the changes respect zeros as background (no overwrite) or do they overwrite non-zero cells (e.g., interior fills)?\n",
      "2) Propose a single rule that explains every training pair exactly.\n",
      "3) Validate the rule against all training examples. If any mismatch occurs, refine the rule.\n",
      "4) Apply the validated rule to the Test Case input to produce the final output grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common ARC patterns to test first (learned from past tasks)\n",
      "- Cross/partition with a full row and full column of a single color (often 8) creating four quadrants:\n",
      "  - One quadrant is often a “template” made of a single non-zero structural color (e.g., 3) within zeros.\n",
      "  - The opposite quadrant may contain a small color-key block (often 2×2) whose cells give recolor mappings per template sub-quadrant.\n",
      "  - Typical concrete instance: a 6×6 template of 0/3 split into four 3×3 subblocks; a 2×2 key in the opposite quadrant gives colors [TL, TR; BL, BR]; recolor 3→key-color within each 3×3 subblock; 0 remains 0. Output size is then the template size (e.g., 6×6), not the whole input.\n",
      "- Rectangle-interior fill with 8:\n",
      "  - For each maximal axis-aligned filled rectangle of a single non-zero color c (e.g., a 2-rectangle, 1-rectangle, 3-rectangle), keep the one-cell-thick perimeter as c and replace all strictly interior cells with 8.\n",
      "  - Only rectangles of size ≥3×3 have a non-empty interior; for thinner blocks (height<3 or width<3), nothing changes.\n",
      "  - Treat each maximal rectangle independently, even if several share the same color.\n",
      "  - Preserve all four borders (top, bottom, left, right) as color c; only the cells with 1≤row-offset≤H-2 and 1≤col-offset≤W-2 become 8. Do not accidentally turn a rightmost or bottom border into 8.\n",
      "- Legend/shape recoloring via a 5-framed region:\n",
      "  - Color 5 often forms closed rectangular frames around a “legend” region that contains a non-5 shape (commonly color 2 or 3).\n",
      "  - Elsewhere in the grid, the exact same shape appears drawn in color 1. Recolor those 1-shapes to match the legend’s interior color while preserving geometry and orientation shown by the training pairs.\n",
      "  - If multiple 5-framed regions exist, the legend is the one that encloses a non-5, non-0 interior pattern; use that interior color as the target recolor.\n",
      "  - Recolor all matching occurrences of the 1-shape across the grid; leave non-matching 1s unchanged unless examples show otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other frequent mechanisms\n",
      "- Separator rows/cols (often a solid non-zero line) denote a split-and-compare or split-and-map operation between regions.\n",
      "- Quadrant aggregation: outputs built per-cell from corresponding cells in four input quadrants using a consistent selection rule (e.g., first/last non-zero, majority). Derive the selection policy strictly from the examples.\n",
      "- Mirrors/rotations/translations: shapes may be copied/rotated/reflected/recolored. If you hypothesize such behavior, determine bounding boxes and transformations from the data rather than assuming fixed coordinates.\n",
      "- Overwrite policy:\n",
      "  - By default, writing occurs into zeros only, preserving existing non-zeros—unless the examples show deliberate overwriting (e.g., interior fills with 8 or recoloring 1→2/3).\n",
      "  - If multiple writes could affect the same cell, infer priority from the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rule-building checklist\n",
      "- Precisely identify structural vs background colors (0 is often background; 5 often frames; 8 often “fill”).\n",
      "- Determine whether the output size equals:\n",
      "  - the input size, or\n",
      "  - a derived subgrid size (e.g., the size of a template region such as 6×6).\n",
      "- For rectangle interior fills:\n",
      "  - Detect maximal uniform rectangles.\n",
      "  - Keep the one-cell border on all four sides in the original color.\n",
      "  - Replace only the strictly interior with 8.\n",
      "- For cross/2×2-key recolor puzzles:\n",
      "  - Find the cross (full row + full column) and thus the four quadrants.\n",
      "  - Identify the template quadrant and the color-key quadrant (often a 2×2).\n",
      "  - Split the template into matching subblocks to map each structural color cell (e.g., 3) to the corresponding key color; leave zeros unchanged.\n",
      "- For 5-framed legend recolor:\n",
      "  - Isolate the 5-bounded legend that actually contains a non-5 shape.\n",
      "  - Use the interior color as the recolor target for all matching 1-shapes elsewhere.\n",
      "  - Orientation/rotation should match exactly as demonstrated by training pairs; do not assume mirroring or rotation if not supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Validation and formatting\n",
      "- Confirm the inferred rule reproduces every training output exactly (cells and dimensions). If not, revise.\n",
      "- Double-check edge cases: borders vs interiors, right/bottom borders, collisions, non-rectangular shapes (no interior).\n",
      "- Output formatting (strict):\n",
      "  - Output only the resulting grid, nothing else (no labels or explanations).\n",
      "  - Use exactly one space between numbers, no leading/trailing spaces.\n",
      "  - Each row on its own line; no extra blank lines.\n",

      "You will be given ARC-style puzzles consisting of grids of integers (colors 0–9), several Training Input→Output pairs, and one Test Case Input. Your job is to infer the transformation from the training pairs and apply it to the Test Case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow this process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Understand the format\n",
      "- Each grid is a rectangle of space-separated integers, one row per line.\n",
      "- Training Examples are labeled “Input:” and “Output:”. The Test Case provides only “Input:”.\n",
      "- The output grid’s size may match the input or differ if the rule implies resizing or stacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Build a hypothesis that explains ALL training pairs\n",
      "- Propose a concrete rule, then verify it against every training pair. If any example contradicts your hypothesis, revise it.\n",
      "- Use the full set of training pairs to constrain orientation, alignment, and collision/overwrite rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Recognize common ARC motifs and how to apply them\n",
      "- Background and frames:\n",
      "  - 0 is often background; large uniform regions or stable frames/bands (e.g., color 5) typically remain unchanged while other colors move or get redrawn.\n",
      "  - When a color forms a full band (all cells in one or more rows/columns), treat it as a fixed “canvas” or wall that other elements compress toward or align with.\n",
      "- Anchor-based stamping (especially with color 4):\n",
      "  - A cluster (template) may contain “anchors” (often 4s) and “fill” (other colors like 1). Learn the template as the relative offsets of fill cells to anchors.\n",
      "  - Then find occurrences elsewhere of anchors in the same relative arrangement (allowing rotation/reflection only if supported by training) and “stamp” the fill cells at the corresponding offsets. Preserve anchors; fill typically overwrites 0s but not protected frame colors unless training shows otherwise.\n",
      "  - Do not require an exact window match unless training supports that; templates often generalize across the whole grid and may reappear around scattered anchors.\n",
      "- Compression toward a band (often color 5):\n",
      "  - If there is a horizontal band (full rows of 5), count per column how many non-5 elements appear above and below the band. Place that many 5s adjacent to the band on each side (above/below), stacking outward away from the band. Remove the original non-5 dots (replace with 0).\n",
      "  - If there is a vertical band (full columns of 5), perform the analogous operation per row (compress left/right into cells adjacent to the band), remove originals, keep the band.\n",
      "  - Newly placed 5s are contiguous runs adjacent to the band whose length equals the count of non-5s on that side in that line (row/column).\n",
      "- Alternating stripe fill anchored by a single nonzero:\n",
      "  - If there is a single nonzero pixel (e.g., 2/3/6/9) and an otherwise empty grid, fill all rows from the top down through that pixel’s original row (inclusive) with vertical alternating stripes of 4 and 0.\n",
      "  - Choose the phase so that the pixel’s column sits on a 4 in those stripes. Concretely, if the pixel’s column is even (0-based) then “4 0 4 0 …” with 4 at col0; if odd, “0 4 0 4 …” with 4 at col1; more generally: place 4s exactly in columns with the same parity as the pixel’s column.\n",
      "  - Then move the original nonzero one row down (same column). Do not overwrite it; the pattern occupies only the rows above/original row while the moved pixel occupies the row below.\n",
      "- Collisions/priority:\n",
      "  - Unless training shows otherwise, moving/adding elements overwrite 0s only, leaving stable frames (e.g., 5) and anchors intact.\n",
      "  - If templates or fills overlap, follow the precedence implied by training (e.g., anchors persist; fills do not overwrite anchors/frames).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Apply the rule to the Test Case precisely\n",
      "- Use the exact same operations, orientations, parities, counts, and overwrite behavior established by training.\n",
      "- For parity-sensitive patterns (like alternating stripes), align the phase (which columns are 4 vs 0) according to the anchoring column demonstrated in training (e.g., align 4s with the special pixel’s column).\n",
      "- For compression tasks, count per row/column, place contiguous runs adjacent to the band, and remove the original scattered dots.\n",
      "- For anchor-based stamping, detect all occurrences of the anchor configuration (including allowed rotations/reflections if demonstrated) and stamp the fill relative to anchors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Output formatting (strict)\n",
      "- Output only the resulting grid, nothing else.\n",
      "- One space between numbers, no leading/trailing spaces on any line.\n",
      "- Use the exact number of rows and columns determined by the rule.\n",
      "- Preserve row order; each row ends with a newline.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Quality checks before submitting\n",
      "- Your rule must explain every training Input→Output pair exactly.\n",
      "- Reproduce fine details: band orientation (horizontal vs vertical), compression counts and adjacency, stripe parity aligned to the anchor’s column, anchoring/stamping geometry, overwrite/priority behavior.\n",
      "- If your first hypothesis yields the Test Case == Input, double-check training; many tasks require nontrivial replication, compression, or parity alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "General tips\n",
      "- Compute bounding boxes of colored regions; inspect relative offsets between special colors (e.g., 4 anchors vs 1 fills).\n",
      "- Check for symmetry, reflections, and rotations only if explicitly supported by training pairs.\n",
      "- When multiple interpretations are possible, prefer the one that is consistent across all training examples and captures exact placements (parity, counts, adjacency).\n"
